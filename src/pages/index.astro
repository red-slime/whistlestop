					<h2>Whistlestop BBQ Festival 2023</h2>

						<article>
							<p>
								<strong>WhistleStop</strong>, the Rocket City BBQ Festival, has
								been a beloved North Alabama tradition since 2001. As a primary
								fundraising event for the EarlyWorks Children's Museum, the
								festival raises funds allowing EarlyWorks to expand its
								offerings and better serve the community over the years. After
								announcing its end last year, we are excited to announce ‚Äì
								WHISTLESTOP IS BACK!
								<br /><br />
								Mark your calendars for <strong>October 20th & 21st</strong>,
								when a reimagined version of WhistleStop returns for its 23rd
								year. Locally headquartered Huntsville company, <strong
									>Integration Innovation, Inc. (i3)</strong
								>, takes over executive sponsorship and production of
								WhistleStop for the benefit of EarlyWorks. The new home for
								WhistleStop is the newly developed and popular <strong
									>MidCity District</strong
								>. In keeping with WhistleStop as a premier fundraiser for the
								EarlyWorks Children's Museum, i3 is committed to producing a
								first-class event for the community while raising money to
								support the exciting new strategic initiative to ‚Äòreimagine‚Äô the
								EarlyWorks Children's Museum.

								EarlyWorks seeks to create a one-of-a-kind science and
								museum-based experience providing incredible hands-on STEAM
								experiences for the youngest learners in our North Alabama
								community. The EarlyWorks plan calls for remodeling the current
								museum into a state-of-the-art, professionally designed museum
								offering STEAM-based play-and-learn spaces. "We Imagine an
								EarlyWorks where children are busy in a lab-like setting,
								tinkering and creating. Professionals guide the children as they
								interact with high-tech tools, such as 3D printers, laser
								cutters, and robotics, and open-ended imagining, testing, and
								problem-solving are at the core of the children's efforts‚Äù,
								stated EarlyWorks Executive Director Bart Williams. i3 CEO Rich
								Kretzschmar shared, ‚ÄúWe are excited to contribute to the
								continued investment in growing our future generations‚Äô
								curiosity in STEAM.‚Äù
